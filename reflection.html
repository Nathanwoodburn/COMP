    <p>
        From creating this site I realized how easy coding in HTML, CSS and JS.<br>
        I've used various HTML website builders but it is much easier to cusomize it when you edit the code directly.<br>
        With a little of research I found the answer to most problems I've had.<br>
        I've found nearly everything I wanted to do with Javascript without much looking.<br>
        This made fixing errors so much easier
    </p>
    <p>
        I've noticed that a lot of creating a site is finding and presenting the information<br>
        My site is just about me and my hobbies and as such doesn't have as much content as I would have liked.<br>
        However, I also think a lot of sites have far too much information which makes it harder to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've also noticed how important the back end of the site is even for static sites.<br>
        This site's backend (Partch) has got slow image loading times limiting how much resolution I can put in my images.<br>
        In addition uploading the files to Partch is quite slow even though the files are very small.<br>
        I would hate to have to use a system like Partch for a full sized website.
